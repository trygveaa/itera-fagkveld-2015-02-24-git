# Git exercises

This repo contains some exercises to help you learn Git.

## Merge

Try to merge the branch exercise/merge into master, resolve the conflicts and
inspect the result. Try to view how you solved the conflict using log --cc.

## Rebase

Try to rebase the branch exercise/rebase on top of master, resolve the
conflicts and inspect the result. Compare the result with the result you got
with a merge from the previous section. Inspect the log of the two with
log --graph.

## Bisect

Find which commit that changed the background of index.html to blue in
exercise/bisect using bisect. (Since this is a constructed example, there may
exist easier solutions to find this than using bisect. However, this is to
learn bisect, so use that. In some cases, there are no easier solutions.)
